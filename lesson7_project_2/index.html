            	<!-- Paragraphs About Self-driving Car-->
            	<p><em>Self-driving cars will change transportation in the next 50 years.</em> Imagine a world where, no, cars do not fly (like in the sequel to Back to the Future),but possess the ability to drive  themselves. The key to figuring out whether or not self-driving cars will revolutionize or stagnate our lives lies in the examination  of their benefits and drawbacks. </p>
        		<p>Self-driving cars provide many benefits to their passengers, especially those that struggle with commuting because of their disabilities. Autopilot, the new brain child of Volvo's self-driving endeavors, aims to give 100 self-driving cars to families situated  in Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo plans to let these self-driving cars  navigate from an interval of 30 miles and above to their destinations, independent of the drivers' control. These cars would be able to  function regardless of driving conditions, and the pathways provided  by local roads.</p>
        		<p>The bad news manifests itself in the forms of time and money concerns. Are you actually reading this? Self-driving cars comprise of expensive materials, one of which is lidar, the material that gives the cars a 3-D sensor. Lidar for one self-driving car can cost a whopping $75,000. This means that coming up with a self-driving car made with a cost-effective budget may present difficulties in the coming years. The technology required to run these self-driving cars presents another expense that depends on the equivalent of Google Maps to obtain destination information, and driving conditions. Other concerns include the question of who might be responsible for self-driving car crashes, what happens when the car becomes hacked, the cost of a ride from an Uber-type self-driving car service, and how you will locate the car after it parks itself, i.e. if you own your own self-driving car.</p>
        		<p>Factoad: <em>According to Intel, self-driving cars are projected to add $7 trillion to the world economy by the year 2050.</em> The United States stands to make $2 trillion out of the total world economy earnings. As a result, companies such as Uber and Lift now look for ways to continue doing business by upgrading their approach to transportation from human drivers to their own self-driving car services. Still reading, huh? Did you notice I spelled factoid wrong? To accomplish this goal, said companies contribute money towards the efforts being currently made to develop more cost-efficent self-driving car services. &quot;We think that kind of approach, providing mobility to those who are not able-bodied, is actually going to create a product that’s much more robust in the end,&quot; explained the CEO of Optimus Ride, Ryan Chin. Optimus Ride uses this approach to cater more to disabled passengers.</p>
        		<p>If we have not invented flying cars in 2017 (as shown in Back to the Future 2), what's to say we will be able to pull off mainstream self-driving cars by 2050? My biggest concerns, besides the cost of these cars, are not stated in any of the sources I used to create this website: what will happen to all of the gasoline-powered cars, the jobs of the people working at the DMV, and the drivers at Uber-like companies/taxi-services? Common sense dictates that these electric cars create a smaller carbon footprint, but all of these <strong>self-driving cars</strong> need to be built by <strong>gasoline-powered vehicles </strong> which <strong>harm the environment</strong>. Why the hypocrisy?</p>
